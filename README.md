# Calculator
The very first app I've tried ! <br>Just listed what all I have implemented - may seem very simple or even silly for experts :yum:
</br>

## Features of the app
- Uses objecthunter **exp4j** Math Expression evaluator for computin input.
- Still formats the result by separate function to make UI Experience better in viewing the results.
- User not allowed to input two consequent math symbols including dot (negative sign excepted).
- MATH symbols are given differentiation with different color using **spanning**.
- **ObjectAnimator** used for changing BackgroundColor of the views for a small duration.
- Buttons are made to have **Ripple effects**.
- **InputMethodManager** to disable Soft keyboard in the Edittext.
- **Threads** to clear the text and animation effect in parallel to show that All clear action performed.
- Created a customised Toast **_VibratingToast_** to show when max length of edit text reached.


### RESULT
The generated signed APK successfully got installed in other phone and worked properly :smile:

#### Note
Feedbacks always welcome for making my learning curve better and better.
